    <h1>What is Image to Braille?</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my Image to Braille conversion site! This website allows you to
      upload an image, and convert it to braille, where one pixel from the image
      is equal to one dot on a braille unicode character. When an image is
      uploaded, the app will first convert it to the bitmap file format, it will
      then color the background if the image is PNG, and then resize the image.
      Once the file is a bitmap image, the algorithm will iterate through the
      image in 2 x 4 chunks, this is because each braille unicode character is 2
      x 4 dots in size. Once the whole image has been converted, the data is
      sent back in JSON format, and read into a div, allowing the user to copy
      the data, and use it as they see fit.
