  <p>Hi!
    Welcome to my Image to Braille conversion app!
    My name is Ciar√°n Melarkey.
    I am a graduate from the Letterkenny Institute of Technology.
    I am an aspiring web developer with a great interest in learning new technologies and languages.
    I primarily developed this website to learn Vue.js.
    I originally developed the image conversion just using Node.js, but I wanted to expand the scope of the project by including an interface for the user to convert their images.
