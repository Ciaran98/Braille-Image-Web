    <p>
      Hi! Welcome to my Image to Braille conversion app! My name is Ciar√°n
      Melarkey. I am a graduate from the Letterkenny Institute of Technology. I
      am an aspiring web developer with a great interest in learning new
      technologies and languages. I primarily developed this website to learn
      Vue.js. I originally developed the image conversion just using Node.js,
      but I wanted to expand the scope of the project by including an interface
      for the user to convert their images.
